This has been the year of the sporadic newsletter, so lots of old stuff in here as I catch up.

## Memes really do come true

A few months ago Niantic bought 8th Wall and I [waxed poetic](https://arbootcamp.com/newsletter/2022/03/ar-bootcamp-19#niantic-bought-8th-wall) about how they should lower their prices. Turns out they did in fact recently introduce a new developer friendly pricing tier at only $10 USD a month! [They even used my meme in their announcement.](https://youtu.be/XwGNsdIbLbA?t=814) I'll probably start making some 8th Wall tutorials in the near future now.

![Meme of person riding a bike labeled as 8th Wall. It is captioned as them creating a great WebAR platform. The next panel has them shoving a stick into the front wheel of the bicycle and is labeled as pricing their product at $99 a month. The last panel shows the person and bike on the ground having crashed.](/images/newsletter/2022/03/8th-wall-meme.jpg)

## Lens Studio upgrades

Lens Studio has had a couple updates since my last newsletter, but my favorite new feature is the new [Code Node](https://docs.snap.com/lens-studio/references/templates/world/code-node/) in the Material Editor that lets you use GLSL code. Being a graphics programmer noob I usually turn to [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) and follow Lens Studio's [conversion guide](https://docs.snap.com/lens-studio/references/guides/lens-features/graphics/materials/material-editor/tutorials/shadertoy-to-lens-studio/).

## Lensathon

Snap is also running a [Lensathon](https://snaplensathon.devpost.com/). They have a top prize of $50,000 USD and you can enter until July 13, 2022. This isn't a US-only competition, it is open to most of the world. I am excited to see all the cool lenses people dream up.

## Other news

TikTok's Effect House is still Mac only, Spark AR is still being updated at a snail's pace, and Snap isn't making any improvements to Snap Camera. So not much new. I suppose I should start making memes of all of them to get them to make some changes. Now all these memes are for changes I would personally love to see, but let me know if you have your own ideas and I'll get meme'ing. Tweet me [@modelsbymike3d](https://twitter.com/modelsbymike3d) if you think of any great features we need.
