## Lens Fest

Lens Fest is tomorrow, so if you are into Snapchat lenses make sure you are [registered](https://lensfest.live/) (it's free). If [my predictions](https://arbootcamp.com/newsletter/2021/11/ar-bootcamp-16#my-snap-ar-predictions) come true I think I'll have to call myself a futurist.

## SparkSL (kinda) demystified

SparkSL is Spark AR's version of GLSL for writing shaders. Half of you probably stopped reading after that last sentence. Long story short, it gives you a ton of control over how something can look. In true Spark AR fashion, their online documentation has about as much substance as season 2 of Tiger King. Fortunately a creator in the community, Adam Ferriss, has a ton of [great examples](https://github.com/aferriss/sparksl-shader-examples) and I was able to figure out how to convert a shader from Shadertoy to SparkSL. I have a written version [here](https://arbootcamp.com/instagram-advanced/shadertoy) (comparable to Tiger King season 2) and a video version [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uNhzkUSPH8) (comparable to Tiger King season 1).

## Spark AR quicktip

While I was working on creating my SparkSL tutorial, the shader compilation step was basically immediate. Then I opened up OBS to record the video tutorial and things grinded to a halt and the shader code would take minutes to compile. Even restarting my computer did not solve this. Both OBS and Spark were using my laptop's integrated GPU, so I tried switching Spark over to my discrete GPU and the compilation process went back to immediate. I don't think many people are recording SparkSL tutorials, but if you run into this issue, you can try this solution (if you have a discrete GPU that is).

## Ultimate Guide to Snapchat

If you are wanting to grow your Snapchat audience, my fellow creator Phil Walton wrote ["The Ultimate Guide to Snapchat"](https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Guide-Snapchat-Phil-Walton/dp/1684428270/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0) which goes over how Snapchat works and how to leverage all its different features. It is concise, to the point, and on my bookshelf.

## Hot take

AR glasses are not going to replace smartphones. I can see them being an accessory like smartwatches currently are, but I don't think they'll be replacing phones.
