## Documentation

The Lens Studio team has done a great job of documenting Lens Studio. They've created a ton of [useful guides](https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/guides/) that walk you through various types of lenses.

If you are scripting, the [API docs](https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/api/) will be your new best friend. Everything is documented, so sometimes the tricky part is figuring out what that thing you need is called.

## Forum

If you have any specific questions, take a [look at the forum](https://support.lensstudio.snapchat.com/hc/en-us/community/topics) and see if anyone's already asked your question. If not, ask away! The Lens Studio team monitors the forum, but the community of lens creators is also super helpful and will often provide an answer before the LS team.
